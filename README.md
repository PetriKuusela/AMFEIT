# AMFEIT
Code package for amplitude-based electrical impedance tomography (AMFEIT) and data. Note that the primary aim for this repository is to share the data used in an article (TODO link here once it is published), and thus, the codes are, honestly, hideous.
If you are looking for EIT codes to work on, please go check out OOEIT (https://github.com/PetriKuusela/OOEIT), which is a (more or less) maintained and clean package meant for building upon!
